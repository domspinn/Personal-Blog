# Personal-Blog

For this weeks challenge, I had to create a responsive 2 page website that logged journal entries. I started by making two simple html files that designed a bare bones website. I then styled them to fit the appropriate feel for the topic of site. Doing this was fairly straight foward. After desinging the website it needed functionality. Thats where the java script comes in. I started by making a function for collecting the data from the form entry. This data was, the title for the entry, and the content for the entry. I had to get the item and log it into local storage. This was so I can parse it and set it to an element. My if statement parsed the local storage information and added it to an h tag and a paragraph tag. It also made sure that the class of the div it created was aligned to the class in my style sheet. The last simple function I created was a dark/light theme function. This was a simple event listener that set the class of the body to a dark theme class. In the style was included a dark background color. Although it needs some refining, all of that wraps up this weeks project first submission.
